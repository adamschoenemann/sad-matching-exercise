# Algorithm Design - Stable Matching
This repo contains code and documentation for the mandatory stable matching
assignment in Algorithm Design on the Software Technology Msc. Sc at ITU Copenhagen.

There is both a mutable standard implementation (`matching.scala`) and an
immutable implementation (`matching_imm.scala`).
